title: "Case Study: Ouse Washes Experience"
---
The Ouse Washes Experience is a fun run, cycle ride and duathlon organised by the Ely Hereward Rotary Club along the Ouse Washes.

Rotary marshals needed radio communications with each other during the event, but previous yearsâ€™ experience had shown that inexpensive hand-held radio did not cover the required area, exacerbated by the location of several marshal points behind raised flood banks.

Cambridgeshire RAYNET provided marshals with a number of business radios, as well as performing radio link analysis to determine the best locations for two portable control stations, manned by RAYNET operators. These operators managed the communications net during the event, ensuring messages were passed efficiently to their intended destinations.
