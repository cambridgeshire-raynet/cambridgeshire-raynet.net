title: "Case Study: Star Shine Stroll"

The Arthur Rank Hospice Star Shine Stroll is a sponsored walk around Cambridge city. The two routes, six and ten miles long, start at Shelford Rugby Club, go around the city, and return to the rugby club where participants receive medals and refreshments.

Since the level of fitness of the participants varies, keeping track of the positions of both the front and rear of the column of walkers is important, as is being able to efficiently summon medical aid if required.

Cambridgeshire RAYNET volunteers walk with event marshals at the front and rear of the event, carrying location beacons transmitting back to event control at the start / finish. This gives the event organiser a real-time view of the progress, and allows them to plan accordingly.

Voice communications also allow any safety issues to be dealt with swiftly, and we typically have direct radio communications with the first aid service provider as well.
